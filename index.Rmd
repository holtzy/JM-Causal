<u>Data analysis</u>: this document summarizes the data analysis leading to the results presented in the paper. It is organized as follow:

- *GWAS description*: a quick description of the vitamin-D GWAS result that is the basis of the mendelian randomization pipeline.
- *GSMR*: description of the GSMR pipeline to find out if Vitamin-D has a causal effect on several mental diseases.
- *LDSC*: usage of LD score regression to assess heritability and genetic correlation with other traits.
- *mtCOJO*: usage of the mtCOJO method to test the putative confounding effect of other risk factors.
